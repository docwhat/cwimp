<Worf:#palmchat> n9mtb: hehehehheheh.
<palmGeek> I run the emu out of a perl script... hold on a sec. 
<Worf:#palmchat> n9mtb: can that be called a worthwhile crash?
<paperclip:#palmchat> network is a must...
<Worf:#palmchat> oh yeah, don't forget to hook it to GPS, so every crook can
                 find your car >G<
<palmGeek> Now start xcopilot with option -gdebug (older versions) or -debug
           gdb (newer versions), and in another window run
<palmGeek> "m68k-palmos-coff-gdb progname", where progname is the program
           created by gcc _without_ the .prc suffix. At gdb prompt, enter
<palmGeek> "target pilot /dev/ttyqf" (xcopilot should have printed the message
           "Debugging on /dev/ptyqf"; for gdb choose the "tty" that belongs to
<palmGeek> this "pty").
