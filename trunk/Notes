These are some notes to myself:

ToDo:

* Add Wimpout (aka turn over) dialog
* Make the AI smarter
* Add Event Queue
* Add Animations


This is how to get debugging to work under UNIX (courtasy of PalmGeek on
IRC):

$command = "/compiling/xcopilot-0.6.6/xcopilot -memversion 2 -bg cyan -bbg cyan -serial -reset -ramsize 8192 -geometry 220x337-2+10" ;

I run the emu out of a perl script... hold on a sec. 

Now start xcopilot with option -gdebug (older versions) or -debug gdb (newer
versions), and in another window run "m68k-palmos-coff-gdb progname", where
progname is the program created by gcc _without_ the .prc suffix. At gdb
prompt, enter "target pilot /dev/ttyqf" (xcopilot should have printed the
message "Debugging on /dev/ptyqf"; for gdb choose the "tty" that belongs to
this "pty").
