CWimp is currently BETA.

Information can be gotten off of my webpage:
http://docwhat.gerf.org/cwimp

This software is licensed ONLY to be used by approved BETA testers.
If you were not contacted for BETA testing by Steve Schwartz or
Christian Holtje, then you have an illegal copy and should email me at:
docwhat@gerf.org

I will then let you enter the BETA program or ask that you distroy your copy
pending the final release of CWimp.

Note:  The software will, in all likely hood, be released under a 'free'
license (free as in freedom).  GPL or BSD are two obvious licenses.
