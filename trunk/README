INFORMATION:

        CWimp is currently BETA.  This is my first palm
        program, and I have worked pretty hard to make it
        be the best I can.

        Information can be gotten off of my webpage:
        http://docwhat.gerf.org/cwimp/

        CWimp is GPL'd software.  Please see the accompaning
        file, COPYING for the license.

PERSONAL NOTE:

        Just a note to you, the person who downloaded this game
        and is reading this.

        Thank you!

        I wrote this because someone I met was not only convinced
        the world needed a Cosmic Wimpout, but because he thought
        I could do it.

        Prior to meeting this guy, I never even heard of Cosmic
        Wimpout, but since then I have met all kinds of fans of
        the game.

        And what a varied bunch of people you are!  Almost every
        bit of feedback I have gotten from people has been positive!

        (FYI: The only negative thing I got was a story about how
        a friend used to play in college....naked...in the dorms...
        Boy oh boy, let me tell you....)

        So from me to you, I can honestly say: Thank you!

        Ciao!

COMPILING Cwimp:

          First off, you'll need the prc-tools for whatever platform
          you use.  I have only tested this under Linux, but it may
          very well compile under Win32, too.  Who knows?

          In addition, you'll have to patch your pilot.ld file
          (see mystart.c for an explanation).  This is because
          CWimp can't fit within 32k.

          Beyond that, You'll need some standard UNIX type tools:
          perl, sed, and a borne-type shell.

          It should hopefully build right out of the box...
