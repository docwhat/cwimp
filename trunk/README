CWimp is currently pre-BETA.

Information can be gotten off of my webpage:
http://docwhat.gerf.org/cwimp/

CWimp is GPL'd software.  Please see the accompaning file, COPYING for
information.

I will gladly accept patches and help in finishing this project, but I
haven't had enough time to normally dedicate the hours and money needed
finish it (mainly a good Palm programming book if such a thing exists).

It was written using GCC under linux.

Ciao!
