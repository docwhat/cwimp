INFORMATION:
        CWimp is currently BETA.  This is my first palm
        program, and I have worked pretty hard to make it
        be the best I can.

        Information can be gotten off of my webpage:
        http://docwhat.gerf.org/cwimp/

        CWimp is GPL'd software.  Please see the accompaning
        file, COPYING for the license.

        Ciao!

COMPILING Cwimp:

          First off, you'll need the prc-tools for whatever platform
          you use.  I have only tested this under Linux, but it may
          very well compile under Win32, too.  Who knows?

          In addition, you'll have to patch your pilot.ld file
          (see mystart.c for an explanation).  This is because
          CWimp can't fit within 32k.

          Beyond that, You'll need some standard UNIX type tools:
          perl, sed, and a borne-type shell.

          It should hopefully build right out of the box...
