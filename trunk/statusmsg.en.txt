DS_Thinking: Thinking...
The AI is trying to think of what to do.  It's
got a small brain.
.

DS_Eclipse: Eclipsed!
With the Eclipse variation in effect, you cannot stay when your
total score equals someone elses.
.

DS_OpeningRoll: Opening Roll
Before you can 'stay' and start saving your points from one turn
to the next, your score for this turn must be
greater or equal to the Opening Roll value (as set when you
started a new game).

If you don't score more than this in a turn, then you get zero
points for the turn and it becomes the next player's turn.

By default you must score in one turn 35 points or more before
you can 'stay'.
.

DS_MustClearFlash: Futtless Rule
The Futtless Rule states that all Flashes must
be cleared.

In a previous turn you, rolled a Flash (a three of a kind).

In order to clear this Flash and continue with your turn,
none of the dice may be the same as your Flash.
If any dice match the Flash, then that
roll doesn't count and you will have to roll again.
.

DS_FreightTrain: Freight Train
If all five dice are the same, then you have scored a Freight Train
and your score is 100 times the type of die you rolled!  You
must roll again as according to You May Not Want To But You Must.

If you rolled all sixes, then you'd instantly win.  If you roll all 10s,
then you'd go SuperNova and loose!
.

DS_YMNWTBYM: Y.M.N.W.T.B.Y.M.
You May Not Want To But You Must:

You have scored with all the dice and are not allowed to 'stay' without
rolling at least one more time.
.

.


TS_LastLicks: Last Licks!
The game is in Last Licks.

Someone has passed the winning score (set in 'New Game') and is the
leader.  The current leader has an 'L' next to their name.

Now, everyone gets to get in their Last Licks or last chance to win.
Each player gets one more chance to score higher than the leader.  If
they pass the leaders score, then *they* become the leader and everyone
still in the game gets a chance to pass the new leader (including the
old leader).

The winner is the last person in the game, the last leader.
.

CSTRING: LostString
%s has lost and is no longer in the game.
.

DS_Lost: %s has lost!
You have lost and are no longer in this game.  Sorry!
.


CSTRING: BumpString
%s was bumped by %s from %d to %d.
.

DS_Bump: Bump!
Playing with the Variation Bump, one player has landed on another player's
score, swapping scores.
.


CSTRING: SamplerString
%s got a Cosmic Sampler for 50 points. Yummy!
.

DS_Sampler: Sampler!
Playing with the Variation Cosmic Sampler, if you get one scoring die
(5 or 10) and one of each of the four other non-scoring dice, you get 50
extra points.
.


CSTRING: SuspendString
%s's turn has been suspended

It is now %s's turn.

.

DS_Suspend: Suspended!
Your turn has been suspended because you took more that the allowed
number of rolls to clear a flash.  When it becomes your turn again,
you will pick up where you left off, trying to clear your flash.
Your turn score will remain as it was.
.


CSTRING: TrainWreckString
%s has had %d Train Wreck(s) (of %d max).
.

DS_TrainWreck: Train Wreck!
If the rule (n)TrainWreck is enabled, then a player may only roll
n Train Wrecks during a game or the player looses.

A Train Wreck is when all 5 dice are rolled, but no points are scored
(a wimpout).
.


CSTRING: NobodyWonString
Everyone has lost.  Game over.
.

DS_NobodyWon: Nobody Won!
Apparently, everyone lost.  There is nobody left to play. So, nobody won
and I'm now lonely.
.


CSTRING: LeaderString
%s is the current Leader!
Everyone still in the game gets one
chance to beat you.
.

DS_Leader: %s is the leader!
You are now the leader.

Everyone gets one chance each to get in their
Last Licks or a last roll to win.  If a player doesn't beat your score, then
they lose and are permanently out of the game.  If they beat your score
then they become the leader and everyone gets one chance to beat their score.
.

CSTRING: WinnerString
%s has won!
.

DS_Winner: %s has won!
You've won!  The universe is yours.

Be careful with it, you should probably
get insurance, it's rather valuable.
.


DS_NextPlayer: %s's Turn
It is the next player's turn.
The previous player decided to 'stay'.

The new player has used no dice for scoring. No points have been scored for
this turn yet.

You can't 'stay' without rolling once at least once.
.

DS_Wimpout: * WIMPOUT *
The previous player has Wimped out, scoring no points in a roll.

It is now the next player's turn.
.

STRING: GenericHelp
Welcome to CWimp!

I am going to try to give you the basics of the game.  Don't worry too much
if I miss something, as help will be available via the 'i' at anytime.

First of all, CWimp is a dice game.  The white dice all have the symbols
for 2, 3, 4, 6, '5' and '10'.  '5' and '10' are the only directly scoring
dice.  Each is worth 5 and 10 points respectively.

The black die has the same symbols, but the 3 is replaced with a Flaming Sun
or wildcard.  You can score it like any other symbol that you choose.  How ever
there are rules that can prevent you from controlling that.

During one turn, you can roll as often as you like as long as you don't
'Wimp Out' (or score nothing) on a roll.  If you 'Stay' (when you are able),
then your score is added to your total and the next person goes.

Each time you score on a dice it is put aside (marked with a dot) and
cannot be rolled on again until you have scored on all dice.
If you score with all your dice (ie, there are dots next to all of them)
then 'You May Not Want To, But You Must' roll the dice again.

If you roll three of a kind, it is called a 'Flash'.  You must score a flash
if you have three of a kind.  That means if you get two symbols and a Flaming
Sun, you must take the flash. A Flash scores 10 times the symbol or score
value. A Flash of 3s is worth 30 and a Flash of '10's is worth 100 points!

You must clear a Flash before you can continue the game.  To clear a Flash,
you roll your non-scoring dice, as if in a normal turn, but you get no
points for that roll (and must roll again) if any of the dice match the
Flash.  Wimping out is a legit way of clearing a flash, however.

A Freight Train is like a Flash, but with 5 dice.  A Freight Train scores
100 times the symbol!  The exception is if you roll a '10' Freight Train,
in which case you've gone Super Nova and lost.  The other exception is if
you roll all 6s, in which case, you won!  Note: You can't roll all 3s, as
the Flaming sun is on the '3' side of the black die.

Upon starting the game, you must score more than opening roll (which defaults
to 35 points, see 'Variants') before you can 'stay'.

To win the game, a player must pass the Winning Score (see 'New Game').
Once someone has passed the winning score, then all the other players
get in Last Licks, one more turn with a chance to pass the leader.

If someone passes the leader, then Last Licks starts again with the
players who haven't already gotten in their Last Licks (and have not
passed the leader).

In addition to the straight forward way to play the game, you can play
Variants that add a different flavour to the game.  See the Variants
menu under 'Options'.

.

STRING: statusClearFlashFirst
Clear Flash First
.

STRING: HelpVariants
Variants are rules that let you play CWimp in new ways.  These
are optional rules, and don't need to be used if you don't want.

Bump:\n
In this variant, if you score the same as another player, then you will
switch scores with that player (you getting the new, higher score and that
person getting your old score).

Eclipse:\n
You cannot 'stay' if your score equals another's score.

Cosmic Sampler:\n
If you get one scoring die (a 5 or 10) and four dice with each of
the non-scoring symbols (2, 3, 4, and 6) then you score a Cosmic
Sampler, worth 50 points.

Suspend:\n
If you take more than (n) rolls to clear a Flash, your turn will be suspended
and your turn will be ended.  Upon it being your turn again, then your
previous turn will be restored, including score.

(n)TrainWrecks:\n
If a player gets (n) Train Wrecks, then that play is out of the game.  If
everyone looses, then the game is over.  A Train Wreck is when all 5 dice are
rolled, but with no score (a wimpout on 5 dice).
.
