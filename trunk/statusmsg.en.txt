leader.  The current leader has an 'L' next to their name.

Now, everyone gets to get in their Last Licks or last chance to win.
Each player gets one more chance to score higher than the leader.  If

STRING: GenericHelp
Welcome to CWimp!

I am going to try to give you the basics of the game.  Don't worry too much
if I miss something, as help will be available via the 'i' at anytime.

First of all, CWimp is a dice game.  The white dice all have the symbols
for 2, 3, 4, 6, '5' and '10'.  '5' and '10' are the only directly scoring
dice.  Each is worth 5 and 10 points respectively.

The black die has the same symbols, but the 3 is replaced with a Flaming Sun
or wildcard.  You can score it like any other symbol that you choose.  How ever
there are rules that can prevent you from controlling that.

During one turn, you can roll as often as you like as long as you don't
'Wimp Out' (or score nothing) on a roll.  If you 'Stay' (when you are able),
then your score is added to your total and the next person goes.

Each time you score on a dice it is put aside (marked with a dot) and
cannot be rolled on again until you have scored on all dice.
If you score with all your dice (ie, there are dots next to all of them)
then 'You May Not Want To, But You Must' roll the dice again.

If you roll three of a kind, it is called a 'Flash'.  You must score a flash
if you have three of a kind.  That means if you get two symbols and a Flaming
Sun, you must take the flash. A Flash scores 10 times the symbol or score
value. A Flash of 3s is worth 30 and a Flash of '10's is worth 100 points!

You must clear a Flash before you can continue the game.  To clear a Flash,
you roll your non-scoring dice, as if in a normal turn, but you get no
points for that roll (and must roll again) if any of the dice match the
Flash.  Wimping out is a legit way of clearing a flash, however.

A Freight Train is like a Flash, but with 5 dice.  A Freight Train scores
100 times the symbol!  The exception is if you roll a '10' Freight Train,
in which case you've gone Super Nova and lost.  The other exception is if
you roll all 6s, in which case, you won!  Note: You can't roll all 3s, as
the Flaming sun is on the '3' side of the black die.

Upon starting the game, you must score more than opening roll (which defaults
to 35 points, see 'Variants') before you can 'stay'.

To win the game, a player must pass the Winning Score (see 'New Game').
Once someone has passed the winning score, then all the other players
get in Last Licks, one more turn with a chance to pass the leader.

If someone passes the leader, then Last Licks starts again with the
players who haven't already gotten in their Last Licks (and have not
passed the leader).

In addition to the straight forward way to play the game, you can play
Variants that add a different flavour to the game.  See the Variants
menu under 'Options'.

ToDo: list and describe variants

Below are the list of the variations of CWimp you can play.

Bump:\n
In this variant, if you score the same as another player, then you will
switch scores with that player (you getting the new, higher score and that
person getting your old score).

Eclipse:\n
You cannot 'stay' if your score equals another's score.

Cosmic Sampler:\n
If you get one scoring die (a 5 or 10) and four dice with each of
the non-scoring symbols (2, 3, 4, and 6) then you score a Cosmic
Sampler, worth 50 points.

FullHouse:\n
ToDo

Suspend:\n
If you take more than (n) rolls to clear a Flash, your turn will be suspended
and your turn will be ended.  Upon it being your turn again, then your
previous turn will be restored, including score.

(n)TrainWrecks:\n
If a player gets (n) Train Wrecks, then that play is out of the game.  If
everyone looses, then the game is over.  A Train Wreck is when all 5 dice are
rolled, but with no score (a wimpout on 5 dice).
