DS_MustClearFlash: Must Clear Flash
In a previous turn you rolled a flash
(a three of a kind).

In order to clear this flash and continue with your turn, all the dice
of your next roll must be different from the flash.  If any dice match
the flash, then that roll doesn't count and you will have to roll again.

DS_YMNWTBYM: Y.M.N.W.T.B.Y.M.
You May Not Want To But You Must:

You have scored with all the dice and are not allowed to 'stay' without
rolling at least one more time.
.


DS_NextPlayer: Next Player's Turn
It is the next player's turn.

The new player has used no dice for scoring. No points have been scored for
this turn yet.

You can't 'stay' without rolling once.
