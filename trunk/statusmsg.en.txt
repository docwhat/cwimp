DS_MustClearFlash: Must Clear Flash
In a previous turn you rolled a Flash
(a three of a kind).

In order to clear this Flash and continue with your turn, all the dice
of your next roll must be different from the Flash.  If any dice match
the Flash, then that roll doesn't count and you will have to roll again.
.


DS_YMNWTBYM: Y.M.N.W.T.B.Y.M.
You May Not Want To But You Must:

You have scored with all the dice and are not allowed to 'stay' without
rolling at least one more time.

TS_LastLicks: Last Licks!
The game is in Last Licks.

Someone has passed the winning score (set in 'New Game') and is the
leader.  The current leader has an 'L' next to their name.

Now, everyone gets to get in their Last Licks or last chance to win.
Each player gets one more chance to score higher than the leader.  If
they pass the leaders score, then *they* become the leader and everyone
still in the game gets a chance to pass the new leader (including the
old leader).

The winner is the last person in the game, the last leader.

chance to beat you.
.

DS_Leader: %s is the leader!
You are now the leader.

Everyone gets one chance each to get in their
Last Licks or a last roll to win.  If a player doesn't beat your score, then
they lose and are permanently out of the game.  If they beat your score
then they become the leader and everyone gets one chance to beat their score.
.


CSTRING: WinnerString
%s has won!
.

DS_Winner: %s has won!
You've won!  The universe is yours.

Be careful with it, you should probably
get insurance, it's rather valuable.
.


DS_NextPlayer: %s's Turn
It is the next player's turn.
The previous player lost their turn or decided to 'stay'.

The new player has used no dice for scoring. No points have been scored for
this turn yet.

You can't 'stay' without rolling once.
.


DS_YMNWTFlash: Clear Flash & YMNWTBYM
You just got a Flash (a three of a kind).
In addition, you scored with all your dice, giving you a
'You May Not Want To But You Must' reroll of all the dice.

Now you get to roll with all five dice to clear your Flash.
You clear a Flash by rolling all symbols that were *not* in your
Flash.

Unfortunately, Wimping Out can clear your Flash.

STRING: GenericHelp
Welcome to CWimp!

I am going to try to give you the basics of the game.  Don't worry too much
if I miss something, as help will be available via the 'i' at anytime.

First of all, CWimp is a dice game.  The white dice all have the symbols
for 2, 3, 4, 6, '5' and '10'.  '5' and '10' are the only directly scoring
dice.  Each is worth 5 and 10 points respectively.

The black die has the same symbols, but the 3 is replaced with a Flaming Sun
or wildcard.  You can score it like any other symbol that you choose.  How ever
there are rules that can prevent you from controlling that.

During one turn, you can roll as often as you like as long as you don't
'Wimp Out' (or score nothing) on a roll.  If you 'Stay' (when you are able),
then your score is added to your total and the next person goes.

Each time you score on a dice it is put aside (marked with a dot) and
cannot be rolled on again until you have scored on all dice.
If you score with all your dice (ie, there are dots next to all of them)
then 'You May Not Want To, But You Must' roll the dice again.

If you roll three of a kind, it is called a 'Flash'.  You must score a flash
if you have three of a kind.  That means if you get two symbols and a Flaming
Sun, you must take the flash. A Flash scores 10 times the symbol or score
value. A Flash of 3s is worth 30 and a Flash of '10's is worth 100 points!

You must clear a Flash before you can continue the game.  To clear a Flash,
you roll your non-scoring dice, as if in a normal turn, but you get no
points for that roll (and must roll again) if any of the dice match the
Flash.  Wimping out is a legit way of clearing a flash, however.

A Freight Train is like a Flash, but with 5 dice.  A Freight Train scores
100 times the symbol!  The exception is if you roll a '10' Freight Train,
in which case you've gone Super Nova and lost.  The other exception is if
you roll all 6s, in which case, you won!  Note: You can't roll all 3s, as
the Flaming sun is on the '3' side of the black die.

Upon starting the game, you must score more than opening roll (which defaults
to 35 points, see 'Variants') before you can 'stay'.

To win the game, a player must pass the Winning Score (see 'New Game').
Once someone has passed the winning score, then all the other players
get in Last Licks, one more turn with a chance to pass the leader.

If someone passes the leader, then Last Licks starts again with the
players who haven't already gotten in their Last Licks (and have not
passed the leader).

In addition to the straight forward way to play the game, you can play
Variants that add a different flavour to the game.  See the Varients
menu under 'Options'.
